    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Roman Sosnovskyi, a passionate web developer with a flair for
      creating elegant solutions in the digital space. My journey into web
      development started with a curiosity about how websites work and a desire
      to make a significant impact through technology.
    </p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      Originally from Lviv, Ukraine, I began my professional path in web
      development after completing my education. During my academic years, I was
      drawn to the world of programming and design, where I discovered my
      passion for creating user-friendly interfaces and scalable applications.
    </p>

    <h3>Technical Expertise</h3>
    <p>
      Since then, I have immersed myself in the dynamic world of web
      development, constantly learning and adapting to new technologies. I
      specialize in frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
      popular frameworks like React.js. I also have experience in backend
      development using Node.js: leveraging its asynchronous and event-driven
      nature to build scalable server-side services. Express.js: fast and
      efficient creation of reliable APIs and web applications. MongoDB: using
      NoSQL databases for flexible data storage solutions. SQL databases (MySQL,
      PostgreSQL): designing relational databases and optimizing queries for
      performance.
    </p>

    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <p>
      My approach to web development combines creativity with technical
      expertise, ensuring that every project I undertake not only meets but
      exceeds client expectations. I thrive in collaborative environments where
      ideas flow freely, and problem-solving is the cornerstone of our success.
    </p>

    <h3>Continuous Improvement</h3>
    <p>
      I believe in continuous improvement and constantly explore new methods to
      refine my skills and stay ahead in this dynamic field. Whether it's
      creating responsive websites, optimizing performance, or integrating
      advanced features, I strive to offer reliable solutions that leave a
      lasting impression.
    </p>

    <h3>Let's Connect</h3>
    <p>
      I am currently exploring new opportunities and I am excited about the
      prospect of contributing to innovative projects. Feel free to reach out if
      you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project together.
